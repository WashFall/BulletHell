High Concept: "Not Dead Yet"

You run around and avoid enemies. They will swarm you 
and you will have to unlock abilities to defend yourself.

The player does not have control over how and when they 
attack, the weapons are controlled automatically. The 
only real control the player has is movement and picking 
the weapons they will use from a random reward as they 
level up.

The goal of the game is to survive for 30 minutes, at 
which point the game ends and the player may permanently 
upgrade their characters stats.
